## Summary
The results of this analysis have given us a look into the use of bikes in the NYC Citibike bike-sharing program by time and gender. Usage rates can now be predicted based on time of day and location. Weekday useage is heavily most popular amongst users during the morning and afternoon commute. On the weekends, usage is less concentrated to one time of the day. A suggestion for further analysis would be to compare weekday and weekend trip durations and to do further analysis for the kind of bikes that are least used and most used. Visulations showing areas with least and most usage would also be helpful.
